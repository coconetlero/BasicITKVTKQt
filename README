This software tool is a very basic Image Processing application. Build for 
demonstrative purposes, in the use of Qt, VTK and ITK libraries together. 

This app, create a GUI with Qt, load and display an image from file using 
VTK in conjunction with Qt. Also you can apply an ITK image filter (median 
filter and Gradient Anisotropic Diffusion filter) and display 
the resulting image. 

In order to compile and run this example you need the following libraries:

Cmake 2.8
InsightToolkit-4.4.2
VTK-5.10.1
Qt 4.8.5 ITK VTK Qt basics

Note: You need to enable the ITKVTKGlue option in the ITK configuration.
